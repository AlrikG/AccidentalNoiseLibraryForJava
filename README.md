## Joise
Joise is a 2D, 3D, 4D and 6D modular noise library written in Java.

Joise is derived from Joshua Tippetts' [Accidental Noise Library](http://accidentalnoise.sourceforge.net/index.html) written in C++.

### Why Joise?
Joise was created to facilitate the creation of complex noise functions from chained modules, and 
represent the chained modules in a consistent format.

Joise was originally created to power the procedural world-building algorithms behind the PC game, 
[Lodestar: Stygian Skies](https://lodestargame.com/home).
